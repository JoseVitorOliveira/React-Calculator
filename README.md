# React-Calculator

This is my first React project - a simple calculator built using React. The styles are inspired by [this repository](https://github.com/JoseVitorOliveira/Responsive-Calculator) , which I created using vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

Features:

- Basic arithmetic operations
- Clear and delete functionality
- Expression evaluation without eval

Feel free to explore and provide feedback!
